DeadJury
========
DeadJury is a 1vs1 guessing game.
##Some history
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of my preparation to be able to access one of the <strong>'Grandes Ecoles'</strong> (<em>Which wasn't a huge success</em>), I came across a pretty fun game that I started to play over and over with some friends with the ultimate goal of becoming the <em>Master</em> of <strong>'bless√©-mort'</strong> as we used to call it. A pretty morose name for such a game. So I managed to translate it to <strong>'DeadJury'</strong> which is a mix of the words 'dead' = 'mort', 'injury' = 'blessure". Cool, Huh?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We needed to use some primitive tools like a pen and a pencil to keep track of the game's cycle. As a result, and after few years of programming, I thought to myself, 'Why not create an application for this cool game?'. <em>And so I did</em>.
