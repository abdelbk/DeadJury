DeadJury
========
DeadJury is a 1vs1 guessing game.
##Some history
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of my preparation to be able to access one of the <strong>'Grandes Ecoles'</strong> (<em>Which wasn't a huge success</em>), I came across a pretty fun game that I started to play over and over with some friends with the ultimate goal of becoming the <em>Master</em> of <strong>'blessé-mort'</strong> as we used to call it. A pretty morose name for such a game. So I managed to translate it to <strong>'DeadJury'</strong> which is a mix of the words 'dead' = 'mort', 'injury' = 'blessure". Cool, Huh?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We needed to use some primitive tools like a pen and a sheet of paper to keep track of the game's cycle. As a result, and after few years of programming, I thought to myself, 'Why not create an application for this cool game?'. <em>And so I did</em>. 
##How to play?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every player should choose a four digits number (The digits should be different and ∊ [1, 9]. The player who finds his opponent's number firt wins the game. 
##An example
Let's assume that the players are <em>Bob</em> and <em>Alice</em><br>
*Bob* chooses **1234**<br>
*Alice* chooses **5678**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*First round*<br>
*Bob* guesses **5247**<br>
*Alice* guesses **1263**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The players exchange their guesses*<br>
*Alice* sees that the clever *Bob* guessed **2** digits : *5* and *7*<br>
In addition, *5* is at the same position of *Alice*'s number => We say that *5* is dead<br>
In the other hand, *7* is not in the same position => We say that *7* is injured<br>
So *Alice* has **1** dead and **1** injured<br>
**Bob will follow the same reasonning and so on**
##Have fun and be the GURU !!
